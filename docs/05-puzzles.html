Wells, a mountain climber named Nunez trips (literally, down an ice slope) into an unknown and isolated valley in the Peruvian Andes.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup></span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="2" data-nb-chars="166" data-nb-words="27" id="idea5">The valley is extraordinarily beautiful, with “sweet water, pasture, an even climate, slopes of rich brown soil with tangles of a shrub that bore an excellent fruit.”</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="3" data-nb-chars="32" data-nb-words="6" id="idea6">But the villagers are all blind.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="4" data-nb-chars="35" data-nb-words="6" id="idea7">Nunez takes this as an opportunity.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="5" data-nb-chars="76" data-nb-words="14" id="idea8">“In the Country of the Blind,” he tells himself, “the One-Eyed Man is King.”</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="6" data-nb-chars="68" data-nb-words="14" id="idea9">So he resolves to live with the villagers to explore life as a king.</span></p>

<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="2" data-nb-chars="55" data-nb-words="11" id="idea11">He tries to explain the idea of sight to the villagers.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="3" data-nb-chars="22" data-nb-words="3" id="idea12">They don't understand.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="4" data-nb-chars="31" data-nb-words="6" id="idea13">He tells them they are “blind.”</span>

<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="7" data-nb-chars="153" data-nb-words="26" id="idea16">Indeed, as they increasingly notice the things he can't do (hear the sound of grass being stepped on, for example), they increasingly try to control him.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="8" data-nb-chars="45" data-nb-words="6" id="idea17">He, in turn, becomes increasingly frustrated.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="9" data-nb-chars="151" data-nb-words="29" id="idea18">“‘You don't understand,' he cried, in a voice that was meant to be great and resolute, and which broke. ‘You are blind and I can see. Leave me alone!’”</span></p>

<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="3" data-nb-chars="163" data-nb-words="29" id="idea21">Not even the ultimate target of his affection, a young woman who to him seems “the most beautiful thing in the whole of creation,” understands the beauty of sight.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="4" data-nb-chars="334" data-nb-words="57" id="idea22">Nunez's description of what he sees “seemed to her the most poetical of fancies, and she listened to his description of the stars and the mountains and her own sweet white-lit beauty as though it was a guilty indulgence.” “She did not believe,” Wells tells us, and “she could only half understand, but she was mysteriously delighted.”</span></p>

<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="1" data-nb-chars="110" data-nb-words="17" id="idea23">When Nunez announces his desire to marry his “mysteriously delighted” love, the father and the village object.</span>

<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="1" data-nb-chars="58" data-nb-words="10" id="idea33">“Thank Heaven for science!” says the father to the doctor.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="2" data-nb-chars="78" data-nb-words="14" id="idea34">They inform Nunez of this condition necessary for him to be allowed his bride.</span>

<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="5" data-nb-chars="59" data-nb-words="9" id="idea41">This possibility is an underused plot for murder mysteries.</span>

<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="4" data-nb-chars="209" data-nb-words="37" id="idea46">Yet in fact, not only can two individuals have the same set of DNA (identical twins), but one person can have two different sets of DNA (a chimera).

<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="2" data-nb-chars="128" data-nb-words="24" id="idea48">For example, in the battle over the question “What is p2p file sharing?” both sides have it right, and both sides have it wrong.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="3" data-nb-chars="169" data-nb-words="30" id="idea49">One side says, “File sharing is just like two kids taping each others' records—the sort of thing we've been doing for the last thirty years without any question at all.”</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="4" data-nb-chars="30" data-nb-words="6" id="idea50">That's true, at least in part.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="5" data-nb-chars="259" data-nb-words="52" id="idea51">When I tell my best friend to try out a new CD that I've bought, but rather than just send the CD, I point him to my p2p server, that is, in all relevant respects, just like what every executive in every recording company no doubt did as a kid: sharing music.</span></p>
<p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="14" data-nb-chars="467" data-nb-words="87">
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="1" data-nb-chars="42" data-nb-words="8" id="idea52">But the description is also false in part.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="2" data-nb-chars="244" data-nb-words="45" id="idea53">For when my p2p server is on a p2p network through which anyone can get access to my music, then sure, my friends can get access, but it stretches the meaning of “friends” beyond recognition to say “my ten thousand best friends” can get access.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="3" data-nb-chars="181" data-nb-words="34" id="idea54">Whether or not sharing my music with my best friend is what “we have always been allowed to do,” we have not always been allowed to share music with “our ten thousand best friends.”</span></p>

<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="1" data-nb-chars="178" data-nb-words="34" id="idea55">Likewise, when the other side says, “File sharing is just like walking into a Tower Records and taking a CD off the shelf and walking out with it,” that's true, at least in part.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="2" data-nb-chars="171" data-nb-words="34" id="idea56">If, after <span id="dictionary-term539" class="dictionary-term" data-dictionary-term="Lovett, Lyle" data-term-index="539">Lyle Lovett</span> (finally) releases a new album, rather than buying it, I go to <span id="dictionary-term496" class="dictionary-term" data-dictionary-term="Kazaa" data-term-index="496">Kazaa</span> and find a free copy to take, that is very much like stealing a copy from Tower.</span></p>

<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="1" data-nb-chars="40" data-nb-words="8" id="idea57">But it is not quite stealing from Tower.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="2" data-nb-chars="78" data-nb-words="17" id="idea58">After all, when I take a CD from Tower Records, Tower has one less CD to sell.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="3" data-nb-chars="113" data-nb-words="25" id="idea59">And when I take a CD from Tower Records, I get a bit of plastic and a cover, and something to show on my shelves.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="4" data-nb-chars="278" data-nb-words="52" id="idea60">(And, while we're at it, we could also note that when I take a CD from Tower Records, the maximum fine that might be imposed on me, under California law, at least, is $1,000. According to the RIAA, by contrast, if I download a ten-song CD, I'm liable for $1,500,000 in damages.)</span></p>

<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="1" data-nb-chars="54" data-nb-words="11" id="idea61">The point is not that it is as neither side describes.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="2" data-nb-chars="102" data-nb-words="21" id="idea62">The point is that it is both—both as the RIAA describes it and as <span id="dictionary-term496" class="dictionary-term" data-dictionary-term="Kazaa" data-term-index="496">Kazaa</span> describes it. It is a chimera.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="3" data-nb-chars="130" data-nb-words="24" id="idea63">And rather than simply denying what the other side asserts, we need to begin to think about how we should respond to this chimera.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="4" data-nb-chars="28" data-nb-words="5" id="idea64">What rules should govern it?</span></p>
<p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="18" data-nb-chars="486" data-nb-words="85">
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="1" data-nb-chars="63" data-nb-words="12" id="idea65">We could respond by simply pretending that it is not a chimera.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="2" data-nb-chars="82" data-nb-words="16" id="idea66">We could, with the RIAA, decide that every act of file sharing should be a felony.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="3" data-nb-chars="119" data-nb-words="19" id="idea67">We could prosecute families for millions of dollars in damages just because file sharing occurred on a family computer.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="4" data-nb-chars="119" data-nb-words="22" id="idea68">And we can get universities to monitor all computer traffic to make sure that no computer is used to commit this crime.</span>

<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="1" data-nb-chars="96" data-nb-words="16" id="idea70">Alternatively, we could respond to file sharing the way many kids act as though we've responded.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="2" data-nb-chars="145" data-nb-words="23" id="idea71">We could totally legalize it. Let there be no copyright liability, either civil or criminal, for making copyrighted content available on the Net.</span>

<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="4" data-nb-chars="181" data-nb-words="38" id="idea76">And while I end this book with a sketch of a system that does just that, my aim in the next chapter is to show just how awful it would be for us to adopt the zero-tolerance extreme.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="5" data-nb-chars="70" data-nb-words="11" id="idea77">I believe <em>either</em> extreme would be worse than a reasonable alternative.</span>
