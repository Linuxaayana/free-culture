<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="2" data-nb-chars="65" data-nb-words="13" id="idea3">It can be owned and sold, and the law protects against its theft.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="3" data-nb-chars="72" data-nb-words="13" id="idea4">Ordinarily, the copyright owner gets to hold out for any price he wants.</span>

<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="1" data-nb-chars="143" data-nb-words="26" id="idea6">But in ordinary language, to call a copyright a “property” right is a bit misleading, for the property of copyright is an odd kind of property.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="2" data-nb-chars="76" data-nb-words="15" id="idea7">Indeed, the very idea of property in any idea or any expression is very odd.</span>

<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="4" data-nb-chars="251" data-nb-words="52" id="idea9">I am taking a thing, the picnic table, and after I take it, you don't have it. But what am I taking when I take the good <em>idea</em> you had to put a picnic table in the backyard—by, for example, going to Sears, buying a table, and putting it in my backyard?</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="5" data-nb-chars="35" data-nb-words="8" id="idea10">What is the thing I am taking then?</span></p>

<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="2" data-nb-chars="158" data-nb-words="26" id="idea12">The point instead is that in the ordinary case—indeed, in practically every case except for a narrow range of exceptions—ideas released to the world are free.</span>

<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="2" data-nb-chars="148" data-nb-words="26" id="idea18">To get a good sense of how this practice of turning the intangible into property emerged, we need to place this “property” in its proper context.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup></span></p>

<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="5" data-nb-chars="33" data-nb-words="6" id="idea23">How does it function in practice?</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="6" data-nb-chars="246" data-nb-words="37" id="idea24">After these stories, the significance of this true statement—“copyright material is property”—will be a bit more clear, and its implications will be revealed as quite different from the implications that the copyright warriors would have us draw.</span></p>

<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="2" data-nb-chars="130" data-nb-words="21" id="idea37">The better-known year in the history of copyright is 1710, the year that the <span id="dictionary-term81" class="dictionary-term" data-dictionary-term="British Parliament" data-term-index="81">British Parliament</span> adopted the first “copyright” act.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="3" data-nb-chars="259" data-nb-words="45" id="idea38">Known as the Statute of Anne, the act stated that all published works would get a copyright term of fourteen years, renewable once if the author was alive, and that all works already published by 1710 would get a single term of twenty-one additional years.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup></span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="4" data-nb-chars="143" data-nb-words="27" id="idea39">Under this law, <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> should have been free in 1731. So why was there any issue about it still being under Tonson's control in 1774?</span></p>
<p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="13" data-nb-chars="541" data-nb-words="94">
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="1" data-nb-chars="95" data-nb-words="17" id="idea40">The reason is that the <span id="dictionary-term194" class="dictionary-term" data-dictionary-term="English" data-term-index="194">English</span> hadn't yet agreed on what a “copy-right” was—indeed, no one had.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="2" data-nb-chars="104" data-nb-words="17" id="idea41">At the time the <span id="dictionary-term194" class="dictionary-term" data-dictionary-term="English" data-term-index="194">English</span> passed the Statute of Anne, there was no other legislation governing copyrights.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="3" data-nb-chars="208" data-nb-words="37" id="idea42">The last law regulating publishers, the Licensing Act of 1662, had expired in 1695. That law gave publishers a monopoly over publishing, as a way to make it easier for the Crown to control what was published.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="4" data-nb-chars="134" data-nb-words="23" id="idea43">But after it expired, there was no <span id="dictionary-term676" class="dictionary-term" data-dictionary-term="positive law" data-term-index="676">positive law</span> that said that the publishers, or “Stationers,” had an exclusive right to print books.</span></p>
<p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="14" data-nb-chars="641" data-nb-words="109">
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="1" data-nb-chars="70" data-nb-words="14" id="idea44">There was no <em>positive</em> law, but that didn't mean that there was no law.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="2" data-nb-chars="161" data-nb-words="29" id="idea45">The Anglo-American legal tradition looks to both the words of legislatures and the words of judges to know the rules that are to govern how people are to behave.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="3" data-nb-chars="51" data-nb-words="8" id="idea46">We call the words from legislatures “positive law.”</span>

And so the real question after the licensing statutes had expired was whether the <span id="dictionary-term126" class="dictionary-term" data-dictionary-term="common law" data-term-index="126">common law</span> protected a copyright, independent of any <span id="dictionary-term676" class="dictionary-term" data-dictionary-term="positive law" data-term-index="676">positive law</span>.</span></p>

<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="1" data-nb-chars="148" data-nb-words="21" id="idea49">This question was important to the publishers, or “booksellers,” as they were called, because there was growing competition from foreign publishers.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="2" data-nb-chars="89" data-nb-words="12" id="idea50">The Scottish, in particular, were increasingly publishing and exporting books to England.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="3" data-nb-chars="159" data-nb-words="25" id="idea51">That competition reduced the profits of the <span id="dictionary-term132" class="dictionary-term" data-dictionary-term="Conger" data-term-index="132">Conger</span>, which reacted by demanding that Parliament pass a law to again give them exclusive control over publishing.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="4" data-nb-chars="55" data-nb-words="9" id="idea52">That demand ultimately resulted in the Statute of Anne.</span></p>

<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="1" data-nb-chars="103" data-nb-words="19" id="idea53">The Statute of Anne granted the author or “proprietor” of a book an exclusive right to print that book.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="2" data-nb-chars="133" data-nb-words="23" id="idea54">In an important limitation, however, and to the horror of the <span id="dictionary-term71" class="dictionary-term" data-dictionary-term="booksellers, English" data-term-index="71">booksellers</span>, the law gave the bookseller that right for a limited term.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="3" data-nb-chars="115" data-nb-words="22" id="idea55">At the end of that term, the copyright “expired,” and the work would then be free and could be published by anyone.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="4" data-nb-chars="50" data-nb-words="9" id="idea56">Or so the legislature is thought to have believed.</span></p>

<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="1" data-nb-chars="100" data-nb-words="18" id="idea57">Now, the thing to puzzle about for a moment is this: Why would Parliament limit the exclusive right?</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="2" data-nb-chars="104" data-nb-words="21" id="idea58">Not why would they limit it to the particular limit they set, but why would they limit the right <em>at all?</em></span></p>

<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="1" data-nb-chars="84" data-nb-words="14" id="idea59">For the <span id="dictionary-term71" class="dictionary-term" data-dictionary-term="booksellers, English" data-term-index="71">booksellers</span>, and the authors whom they represented, had a very strong claim.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="2" data-nb-chars="74" data-nb-words="13" id="idea60">Take <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> as an example: That play was written by <span id="dictionary-term791" class="dictionary-term" data-dictionary-term="Shakespeare, William" data-term-index="791">Shakespeare</span>.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="3" data-nb-chars="49" data-nb-words="10" id="idea61">It was his genius that brought it into the world.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="4" data-nb-chars="195" data-nb-words="35" id="idea62">He didn't take anybody's property when he created this play (that's a controversial claim, but never mind), and by his creating this play, he didn't make it any harder for others to craft a play.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="5" data-nb-chars="139" data-nb-words="25" id="idea63">So why is it that the law would ever allow someone <span id="dictionary-term316" class="dictionary-term" data-dictionary-term="Else, Jon" data-term-index="316">else</span> to come along and take Shakespeare's play without his, or his estate's, permission?</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="6" data-nb-chars="73" data-nb-words="12" id="idea64">What reason is there to allow someone <span id="dictionary-term316" class="dictionary-term" data-dictionary-term="Else, Jon" data-term-index="316">else</span> to “steal” Shakespeare's work?</span></p>

<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="1" data-nb-chars="30" data-nb-words="6" id="idea65">The answer comes in two parts.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="2" data-nb-chars="119" data-nb-words="22" id="idea66">We first need to see something special about the notion of “copyright” that existed at the time of the Statute of Anne.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="3" data-nb-chars="63" data-nb-words="9" id="idea67">Second, we have to see something important about “booksellers.”</span></p>
<p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="20" data-nb-chars="719" data-nb-words="130">
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="1" data-nb-chars="23" data-nb-words="3" id="idea68">First, about copyright.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="2" data-nb-chars="100" data-nb-words="18" id="idea69">In the last three hundred years, we have come to apply the concept of “copyright” ever more broadly.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="3" data-nb-chars="75" data-nb-words="16" id="idea70">But in 1710, it wasn't so much a concept as it was a very particular right.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="4" data-nb-chars="104" data-nb-words="18" id="idea71">The copyright was born as a very specific set of restrictions: It forbade others from reprinting a book.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="5" data-nb-chars="97" data-nb-words="17" id="idea72">In 1710, the “copy-right” was a right to use a particular machine to replicate a particular work.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="6" data-nb-chars="44" data-nb-words="9" id="idea73">It did not go beyond that very narrow right.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="7" data-nb-chars="63" data-nb-words="13" id="idea74">It did not control any more generally how a work could be <em>used</em>.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="8" data-nb-chars="213" data-nb-words="36" id="idea75">Today the right includes a large collection of restrictions on the freedom of others: It grants the author the exclusive right to copy, the exclusive right to distribute, the exclusive right to perform, and so on.</span></p>
<p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="21" data-nb-chars="523" data-nb-words="87">
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="1" data-nb-chars="241" data-nb-words="39" id="idea76">So, for example, even if the copyright to Shakespeare's works were perpetual, all that would have meant under the original meaning of the term was that no one could reprint Shakespeare's work without the permission of the <span id="dictionary-term791" class="dictionary-term" data-dictionary-term="Shakespeare, William" data-term-index="791">Shakespeare</span> estate.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="2" data-nb-chars="191" data-nb-words="32" id="idea77">It would not have controlled anything, for example, about how the work could be performed, whether the work could be translated, or whether <span id="dictionary-term76" class="dictionary-term" data-dictionary-term="Branagh, Kenneth" data-term-index="76">Kenneth Branagh</span> would be allowed to make his films.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="3" data-nb-chars="91" data-nb-words="16" id="idea78">The “copy-right” was only an exclusive right to print—no less, of course, but also no more.</span></p>

<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="1" data-nb-chars="66" data-nb-words="11" id="idea79">Even that limited right was viewed with skepticism by the British.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="2" data-nb-chars="116" data-nb-words="18" id="idea80">They had had a long and ugly experience with “exclusive rights,” especially “exclusive rights” granted by the Crown.</span>

<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="1" data-nb-chars="57" data-nb-words="9" id="idea417">This privilege becomes reserved for two sorts of reasons.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="2" data-nb-chars="79" data-nb-words="14" id="idea418">The first continues the story of the last chapter: the vagueness of “fair use.”</span>

<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="5" data-nb-chars="176" data-nb-words="30" id="idea421">That leads to the second reason that the privilege is reserved for the few: The costs of negotiating the legal rights for the creative reuse of content are astronomically high.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="6" data-nb-chars="188" data-nb-words="37" id="idea422">These costs mirror the costs with fair use: You either pay a lawyer to defend your <span id="dictionary-term332" class="dictionary-term" data-dictionary-term="fair use" data-term-index="332">fair use</span> rights or pay a lawyer to track down permissions so you don't have to rely upon <span id="dictionary-term332" class="dictionary-term" data-dictionary-term="fair use" data-term-index="332">fair use</span> rights.</span>

<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="3" data-nb-chars="163" data-nb-words="28" id="idea682">But given a set of norms, and a <span id="dictionary-term898" class="dictionary-term" data-dictionary-term="background of" data-term-index="898">background of</span> property and contract law, the market imposes a simultaneous constraint upon how an individual or group might behave.</span></p>

<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="3" data-nb-chars="187" data-nb-words="31" id="idea698">It is in part restricted by architecture: speed bumps, for example, slow most rational drivers; governors in buses, as another example, set the maximum rate at which the driver can drive.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="4" data-nb-chars="146" data-nb-words="23" id="idea699">The freedom is in part restricted by the market: Fuel efficiency drops as speed increases, thus the <span id="dictionary-term301" class="dictionary-term" data-dictionary-term="price of" data-term-index="301">price of</span> gasoline indirectly constrains speed.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="5" data-nb-chars="84" data-nb-words="16" id="idea700">And finally, the norms of a community may or may not constrain the freedom to speed.</span>

<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="2" data-nb-chars="108" data-nb-words="17" id="idea704">The law, in other words, sometimes operates to increase or decrease the constraint of a particular modality.</span>

<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="3" data-nb-chars="127" data-nb-words="24" id="idea987">Copyright law would have nothing to say about whether you read the book once, ten times, or every night before you went to bed.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="4" data-nb-chars="118" data-nb-words="19" id="idea988">None of those instances of use—reading—could be regulated by copyright law because none of those uses produced a copy.</span></p>
<p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="271" data-nb-chars="601" data-nb-words="113">
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="1" data-nb-chars="83" data-nb-words="16" id="idea989">But the same book as an e-book is effectively governed by a different set of rules.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="2" data-nb-chars="278" data-nb-words="49" id="idea990">Now if the copyright owner says you may read the book only once or only once a month, then <em>copyright law</em> would aid the copyright owner in exercising this degree of control, because of the accidental feature of copyright law that triggers its application upon there being a copy.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="3" data-nb-chars="240" data-nb-words="48" id="idea991">Now if you read the book ten times and the license says you may read it only five times, then whenever you read the book (or any portion of it) beyond the fifth time, you are making a copy of the book contrary to the copyright owner's wish.</span></p>
<p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="272" data-nb-chars="227" data-nb-words="46">
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="1" data-nb-chars="57" data-nb-words="10" id="idea992">There are some people who think this makes perfect sense.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="2" data-nb-chars="68" data-nb-words="15" id="idea993">My aim just now is not to argue about whether it makes sense or not.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="3" data-nb-chars="40" data-nb-words="9" id="idea994">My aim is only to make clear the change.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="4" data-nb-chars="62" data-nb-words="12" id="idea995">Once you see this point, a few other points also become clear:</span></p>
<p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="273" data-nb-chars="373" data-nb-words="62">
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="1" data-nb-chars="82" data-nb-words="13" id="idea996">First, making category 1 disappear is not anything any policy maker ever intended.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="2" data-nb-chars="103" data-nb-words="15" id="idea997">Congress did not think through the collapse of the presumptively unregulated uses of copyrighted works.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="3" data-nb-chars="112" data-nb-words="22" id="idea998">There is no evidence at all that policy makers had this idea in mind when they allowed our policy here to shift.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="4" data-nb-chars="76" data-nb-words="12" id="idea999">Unregulated uses were an important part of free culture before the Internet.</span></p>

<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="1" data-nb-chars="101" data-nb-words="15" id="idea1000">Second, this shift is especially troubling in the context of transformative uses of creative content.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="2" data-nb-chars="60" data-nb-words="10" id="idea1001">Again, we can all understand the wrong in <span id="dictionary-term661" class="dictionary-term" data-dictionary-term="commercial" data-term-index="661">commercial</span> piracy.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="3" data-nb-chars="98" data-nb-words="17" id="idea1002">But the law now purports to regulate <em>any</em> transformation you make of creative work using a machine.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="4" data-nb-chars="51" data-nb-words="9" id="idea1003">“Copy and paste” and “cut and paste” become crimes.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="5" data-nb-chars="114" data-nb-words="19" id="idea1004">Tinkering with a story and releasing it to others exposes the tinkerer to at least a requirement of justification.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="6" data-nb-chars="160" data-nb-words="23" id="idea1005">However troubling the expansion with respect to copying a particular work, it is extraordinarily troubling with respect to transformative uses of creative work.</span></p>

<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="1" data-nb-chars="143" data-nb-words="26" id="idea1006">Third, this shift from category 1 to category 2 puts an extraordinary burden on category 3 (“fair use”) that <span id="dictionary-term332" class="dictionary-term" data-dictionary-term="fair use" data-term-index="332">fair use</span> never before had to bear.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="2" data-nb-chars="172" data-nb-words="34" id="idea1007">If a copyright owner now tried to control how many times I could read a book on-line, the natural response would be to argue that this is a violation of my <span id="dictionary-term332" class="dictionary-term" data-dictionary-term="fair use" data-term-index="332">fair use</span> rights.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="3" data-nb-chars="215" data-nb-words="39" id="idea1008">But there has never been any litigation about whether I have a <span id="dictionary-term332" class="dictionary-term" data-dictionary-term="fair use" data-term-index="332">fair use</span> right to read, because before the Internet, reading did not trigger the application of copyright law and hence the need for a <span id="dictionary-term332" class="dictionary-term" data-dictionary-term="fair use" data-term-index="332">fair use</span> defense.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="4" data-nb-chars="85" data-nb-words="13" id="idea1009">The right to read was effectively protected before because reading was not regulated.</span></p>
<p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="276" data-nb-chars="439" data-nb-words="70">
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="1" data-nb-chars="81" data-nb-words="14" id="idea1010">This point about <span id="dictionary-term332" class="dictionary-term" data-dictionary-term="fair use" data-term-index="332">fair use</span> is totally ignored, even by advocates for free culture.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="2" data-nb-chars="159" data-nb-words="24" id="idea1011">We have been cornered into arguing that our rights depend upon fair use—never even addressing the earlier question about the expansion in effective regulation.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="3" data-nb-chars="98" data-nb-words="17" id="idea1012">A thin protection grounded in <span id="dictionary-term332" class="dictionary-term" data-dictionary-term="fair use" data-term-index="332">fair use</span> makes sense when the vast majority of uses are <em>unregulated</em>.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="4" data-nb-chars="101" data-nb-words="15" id="idea1013">But when everything becomes presumptively regulated, then the protections of <span id="dictionary-term332" class="dictionary-term" data-dictionary-term="fair use" data-term-index="332">fair use</span> are not enough.</span></p>

<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="3" data-nb-chars="124" data-nb-words="20" id="idea1020">The idea was to expand their “selling by sampling” technique by giving on-line stores the same ability to enable “browsing.”</span>

<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="2" data-nb-chars="42" data-nb-words="8" id="idea1558">The enemy is regulation that does no good.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="3" data-nb-chars="154" data-nb-words="27" id="idea1559">So the question that we should be asking just now is whether extending the regulations of copyright law into each of these domains actually does any good.</span></p>

<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="3" data-nb-chars="163" data-nb-words="26" id="idea1562">And increasingly, for the reasons sketched especially in chapters 7 and 8, one might well wonder whether it does more harm than good for <span id="dictionary-term661" class="dictionary-term" data-dictionary-term="commercial" data-term-index="661">commercial</span> transformation.</span>

<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="1" data-nb-chars="64" data-nb-words="10" id="idea1564">The issue is therefore not simply whether copyright is property.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="2" data-nb-chars="372" data-nb-words="59" id="idea1565">Of course copyright is a kind of “property,” and of course, as with any property, the state ought to protect it. But first impressions notwithstanding, historically, this property right (as with all property rights<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn58" id="fnref58">[58]</a></sup>) has been crafted to balance the important need to give authors and artists incentives with the equally important need to assure access to creative work.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="3" data-nb-chars="65" data-nb-words="11" id="idea1566">This balance has always been struck in light of new technologies.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="4" data-nb-chars="142" data-nb-words="26" id="idea1567">And for almost half of our tradition, the “copyright” did not control <em>at all</em> the freedom of others to build upon or transform a creative work.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="5" data-nb-chars="124" data-nb-words="20" id="idea1568">American culture was born free, and for almost 180 years our country consistently protected a vibrant and rich free culture.</span></p>
<p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="425" data-nb-chars="986" data-nb-words="160">
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="1" data-nb-chars="127" data-nb-words="20" id="idea1569">We achieved that free culture because our law respected important limits on the <span id="dictionary-term173" class="dictionary-term" data-dictionary-term="scope of" data-term-index="173">scope of</span> the interests protected by “property.”</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="2" data-nb-chars="725" data-nb-words="117" id="idea1570">The very birth of “copyright” as a statutory right recognized those limits, by granting copyright owners protection for a limited time only (the story of chapter 6). The tradition of “fair use” is <span id="dictionary-term359" class="dictionary-term" data-dictionary-term="animated" data-term-index="359">animated</span> by a similar concern that is increasingly under strain as the costs of exercising any <span id="dictionary-term332" class="dictionary-term" data-dictionary-term="fair use" data-term-index="332">fair use</span> right become unavoidably high (the story of chapter 7). Adding statutory rights where markets might stifle <span id="dictionary-term440" class="dictionary-term" data-dictionary-term="innovation" data-term-index="440">innovation</span> is another familiar limit on the property right that copyright is (chapter 8). And granting <span id="dictionary-term28" class="dictionary-term" data-dictionary-term="archives, digital" data-term-index="28">archives</span> and libraries a broad freedom to collect, claims of property notwithstanding, is a crucial part of guaranteeing the soul of a culture (chapter 9). Free cultures, like free markets, are built with property.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="3" data-nb-chars="134" data-nb-words="23" id="idea1571">But the nature of the property that builds a free culture is very different from the extremist vision that dominates the debate today.</span></p>
<p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="426" data-nb-chars="680" data-nb-words="111">
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="1" data-nb-chars="64" data-nb-words="11" id="idea1572">Free culture is increasingly the casualty in this war on piracy.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="2" data-nb-chars="280" data-nb-words="44" id="idea1573">In response to a real, if not yet quantified, threat that the technologies of the Internet present to twentieth-century business models for producing and distributing culture, the law and technology are being transformed in a way that will undermine our tradition of free culture.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="3" data-nb-chars="190" data-nb-words="33" id="idea1574">The property right that is copyright is no longer the balanced right that it was, or was intended to be. The property right that is copyright has become unbalanced, tilted toward an extreme.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="4" data-nb-chars="146" data-nb-words="23" id="idea1575">The opportunity to create and transform becomes weakened in a world in which creation requires permission and creativity must check with a lawyer.</span></p>
