The play was first published in 1597. It was the eleventh major play that Shakespeare had written.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="28" id="idea28" data-nb-words="22" data-nb-chars="134">He would continue to write plays through 1613, and the plays that he wrote have continued to define Anglo-American culture ever since.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="29" id="idea29" data-nb-words="21" data-nb-chars="127">So deeply have the works of a sixteenth-century writer seeped into our culture that we often don’t even recognize their source.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="30" id="idea30" data-nb-words="22" data-nb-chars="132">I once overheard someone commenting on Kenneth Branagh’s adaptation of Henry V: “I liked it, but Shakespeare is so full of clichés.”</span></p>
      <p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="11" id="chunk11" data-nb-words="111" data-nb-chars="657"><span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="31" id="idea31" data-nb-words="33" data-nb-chars="188">In 1774, almost 180 years after <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> was written, the “copy-right” for the work was still thought by many to be the exclusive right of a single London publisher, Jacob Tonson.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:98"><a href="#fn:98">3</a></sup></span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="32" id="idea32" data-nb-words="23" data-nb-chars="148">Tonson was the most prominent of a small group of publishers called the Conger<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:99"><a href="#fn:99">4</a></sup> who controlled bookselling in England during the eighteenth century.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="33" id="idea33" data-nb-words="18" data-nb-chars="104">The Conger claimed a perpetual right to control the “copy” of books that they had acquired from authors.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="34" id="idea34" data-nb-words="20" data-nb-chars="108">That perpetual right meant that no one else could publish copies of a book to which they held the copyright.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="35" id="idea35" data-nb-words="17" data-nb-chars="109">Prices of the classics were thus kept high; competition to produce better or cheaper editions was eliminated.</span></p>

        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="37" id="idea37" data-nb-words="21" data-nb-chars="130">The better-known year in the history of copyright is 1710, the year that the British Parliament adopted the first “copyright” act.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="38" id="idea38" data-nb-words="45" data-nb-chars="257">Known as the Statute of Anne, the act stated that all published works would get a copyright term of fourteen years, renewable once if the author was alive, and that all works already published by 1710 would get a single term of twenty-one additional years.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:100"><a href="#fn:100">5</a></sup></span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="39" id="idea39" data-nb-words="27" data-nb-chars="143">Under this law, <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> should have been free in 1731. So why was there any issue about it still being under Tonson’s control in 1774?</span></p>
      <p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="13" id="chunk13" data-nb-words="94" data-nb-chars="541"><span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="40" id="idea40" data-nb-words="17" data-nb-chars="95">The reason is that the English hadn’t yet agreed on what a “copy-right” was—indeed, no one had.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="41" id="idea41" data-nb-words="17" data-nb-chars="104">At the time the English passed the Statute of Anne, there was no other legislation governing copyrights.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="42" id="idea42" data-nb-words="37" data-nb-chars="208">The last law regulating publishers, the Licensing Act of 1662, had expired in 1695. That law gave publishers a monopoly over publishing, as a way to make it easier for the Crown to control what was published.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="43" id="idea43" data-nb-words="23" data-nb-chars="134">But after it expired, there was no positive law that said that the publishers, or “Stationers,” had an exclusive right to print books.</span></p>
      <p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="14" id="chunk14" data-nb-words="109" data-nb-chars="641"><span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="44" id="idea44" data-nb-words="14" data-nb-chars="70">There was no <em>positive</em> law, but that didn’t mean that there was no law.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="45" id="idea45" data-nb-words="29" data-nb-chars="161">The Anglo-American legal tradition looks to both the words of legislatures and the words of judges to know the rules that are to govern how people are to behave.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="46" id="idea46" data-nb-words="8" data-nb-chars="51">We call the words from legislatures “positive law.”</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="47" id="idea47" data-nb-words="8" data-nb-chars="43">We call the words from judges “common law.”</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="48" id="idea48" data-nb-words="50" data-nb-chars="316">The common law sets the background against which legislatures legislate; the legislature, ordinarily, can trump that background only if it passes a law to displace it. And so the real question after the licensing statutes had expired was whether the common law protected a copyright, independent of any positive law.</span></p>
      <p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="15" id="chunk15" data-nb-words="67" data-nb-chars="451"><span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="49" id="idea49" data-nb-words="21" data-nb-chars="148">This question was important to the publishers, or “booksellers,” as they were called, because there was growing competition from foreign publishers.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="50" id="idea50" data-nb-words="12" data-nb-chars="89">The Scottish, in particular, were increasingly publishing and exporting books to England.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="51" id="idea51" data-nb-words="25" data-nb-chars="159">That competition reduced the profits of the Conger, which reacted by demanding that Parliament pass a law to again give them exclusive control over publishing.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="52" id="idea52" data-nb-words="9" data-nb-chars="55">That demand ultimately resulted in the Statute of Anne.</span></p>
      <p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="16" id="chunk16" data-nb-words="73" data-nb-chars="401"><span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="53" id="idea53" data-nb-words="19" data-nb-chars="103">The Statute of Anne granted the author or “proprietor” of a book an exclusive right to print that book.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="54" id="idea54" data-nb-words="23" data-nb-chars="133">In an important limitation, however, and to the horror of the booksellers, the law gave the bookseller that right for a limited term.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="55" id="idea55" data-nb-words="22" data-nb-chars="115">At the end of that term, the copyright “expired,” and the work would then be free and could be published by anyone.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="56" id="idea56" data-nb-words="9" data-nb-chars="50">Or so the legislature is thought to have believed.</span></p>
      <p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="17" id="chunk17" data-nb-words="39" data-nb-chars="204"><span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="57" id="idea57" data-nb-words="18" data-nb-chars="100">Now, the thing to puzzle about for a moment is this: Why would Parliament limit the exclusive right?</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="58" id="idea58" data-nb-words="21" data-nb-chars="104">Not why would they limit it to the particular limit they set, but why would they limit the right <em>at all?</em></span></p>
      <p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="18" id="chunk18" data-nb-words="109" data-nb-chars="614"><span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="59" id="idea59" data-nb-words="14" data-nb-chars="84">For the booksellers, and the authors whom they represented, had a very strong claim.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="60" id="idea60" data-nb-words="13" data-nb-chars="74">Take <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> as an example: That play was written by Shakespeare.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="61" id="idea61" data-nb-words="10" data-nb-chars="49">It was his genius that brought it into the world.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="62" id="idea62" data-nb-words="35" data-nb-chars="195">He didn’t take anybody’s property when he created this play (that’s a controversial claim, but never mind), and by his creating this play, he didn’t make it any harder for others to craft a play.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="63" id="idea63" data-nb-words="25" data-nb-chars="139">So why is it that the law would ever allow someone else to come along and take Shakespeare’s play without his, or his estate’s, permission?</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="64" id="idea64" data-nb-words="12" data-nb-chars="73">What reason is there to allow someone else to “steal” Shakespeare’s work?</span></p>
      <p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="19" id="chunk19" data-nb-words="37" data-nb-chars="212"><span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="65" id="idea65" data-nb-words="6" data-nb-chars="30">The answer comes in two parts.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="66" id="idea66" data-nb-words="22" data-nb-chars="119">We first need to see something special about the notion of “copyright” that existed at the time of the Statute of Anne.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="67" id="idea67" data-nb-words="9" data-nb-chars="63">Second, we have to see something important about “booksellers.”</span></p>
      <p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="20" id="chunk20" data-nb-words="130" data-nb-chars="719"><span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="68" id="idea68" data-nb-words="3" data-nb-chars="23">First, about copyright.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="69" id="idea69" data-nb-words="18" data-nb-chars="100">In the last three hundred years, we have come to apply the concept of “copyright” ever more broadly.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="70" id="idea70" data-nb-words="16" data-nb-chars="75">But in 1710, it wasn’t so much a concept as it was a very particular right.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="71" id="idea71" data-nb-words="18" data-nb-chars="104">The copyright was born as a very specific set of restrictions: It forbade others from reprinting a book.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="72" id="idea72" data-nb-words="17" data-nb-chars="97">In 1710, the “copy-right” was a right to use a particular machine to replicate a particular work.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="73" id="idea73" data-nb-words="9" data-nb-chars="44">It did not go beyond that very narrow right.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="74" id="idea74" data-nb-words="13" data-nb-chars="63">It did not control any more generally how a work could be <em>used</em>.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="75" id="idea75" data-nb-words="36" data-nb-chars="213">Today the right includes a large collection of restrictions on the freedom of others: It grants the author the exclusive right to copy, the exclusive right to distribute, the exclusive right to perform, and so on.</span></p>
      <p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="21" id="chunk21" data-nb-words="87" data-nb-chars="523"><span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="76" id="idea76" data-nb-words="39" data-nb-chars="241">So, for example, even if the copyright to Shakespeare’s works were perpetual, all that would have meant under the original meaning of the term was that no one could reprint Shakespeare’s work without the permission of the Shakespeare estate.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="77" id="idea77" data-nb-words="32" data-nb-chars="191">It would not have controlled anything, for example, about how the work could be performed, whether the work could be translated, or whether Kenneth Branagh would be allowed to make his films.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="78" id="idea78" data-nb-words="16" data-nb-chars="91">The “copy-right” was only an exclusive right to print—no less, of course, but also no more.</span></p>
      <p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="22" id="chunk22" data-nb-words="113" data-nb-chars="683"><span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="79" id="idea79" data-nb-words="11" data-nb-chars="66">Even that limited right was viewed with skepticism by the British.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="80" id="idea80" data-nb-words="18" data-nb-chars="116">They had had a long and ugly experience with “exclusive rights,” especially “exclusive rights” granted by the Crown.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="81" id="idea81" data-nb-words="23" data-nb-chars="149">The English had fought a civil war in part about the Crown’s practice of handing out monopolies—especially monopolies for works that already existed.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="82" id="idea82" data-nb-words="19" data-nb-chars="99">King Henry VIII granted a patent to print the Bible and a monopoly to Darcy to print playing cards.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="83" id="idea83" data-nb-words="13" data-nb-chars="75">The English Parliament began to fight back against this power of the Crown.</span>

        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="274" id="idea274" data-nb-words="19" data-nb-chars="113">In 1993, he launched an initiative to develop a product to build retrospectives on the work of particular actors.</span>

        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="279" id="idea279" data-nb-words="14" data-nb-chars="82">Because Starwave produced those interviews, it was free to include them on the CD.</span></p>

But first impressions notwithstanding, historically, this property right (as with all property rights<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:153"><a href="#fn:153">58</a></sup>) has been crafted to balance the important need to give authors and artists incentives with the equally important need to assure access to creative work.</span>

        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="1440" id="idea1440" data-nb-words="26" data-nb-chars="142">And for almost half of our tradition, the “copyright” did not control <em>at all</em> the freedom of others to build upon or transform a creative work.</span>

The tradition of “fair use” is animated by a similar concern that is increasingly under strain as the costs of exercising any fair use right become unavoidably high (the story of chapter 7). Adding statutory rights where markets might stifle innovation is another familiar limit on the property right that copyright is (chapter 8). And granting archives and libraries a broad freedom to collect, claims of property notwithstanding, is a crucial part of guaranteeing the soul of a culture (chapter 9). Free cultures, like free markets, are built with property.</span>
