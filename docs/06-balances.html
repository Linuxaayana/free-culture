      <p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="11" id="chunk11" data-nb-words="68" data-nb-chars="417"><span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="35" id="idea35" data-nb-words="14" data-nb-chars="82"><strong>In 1995,</strong> a father was frustrated that his daughters didn’t seem to like Hawthorne.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="36" id="idea36" data-nb-words="34" data-nb-chars="191">No doubt there was more than one such father, but at least one did something about it. Eric Eldred, a retired computer programmer living in New Hampshire, decided to put Hawthorne on the Web.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="37" id="idea37" data-nb-words="20" data-nb-chars="144">An electronic version, Eldred thought, with links to pictures and explanatory text, would make this nineteenth-century author’s work come alive.</span></p>
      <p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="12" id="chunk12" data-nb-words="49" data-nb-chars="289"><span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="38" id="idea38" data-nb-words="7" data-nb-chars="42">It didn’t work—at least for his daughters.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="39" id="idea39" data-nb-words="9" data-nb-chars="60">They didn’t find Hawthorne any more interesting than before.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="40" id="idea40" data-nb-words="33" data-nb-chars="187">But Eldred’s experiment gave birth to a hobby, and his hobby begat a cause: Eldred would build a library of public domain works by scanning these works and making them available for free.</span></p>
      <p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="13" id="chunk13" data-nb-words="73" data-nb-chars="469"><span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="41" id="idea41" data-nb-words="37" data-nb-chars="204">Eldred’s library was not simply a copy of certain public domain works, though even a copy would have been of great value to people across the world who can’t get access to printed versions of these works.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="42" id="idea42" data-nb-words="11" data-nb-chars="78">Instead, Eldred was producing derivative works from these public domain works.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="43" id="idea43" data-nb-words="25" data-nb-chars="187">Just as Disney turned Grimm into stories more accessible to the twentieth century, Eldred transformed Hawthorne, and many others, into a form more accessible—technically accessible—today.</span></p>
      <p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="14" id="chunk14" data-nb-words="103" data-nb-chars="654"><span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="44" id="idea44" data-nb-words="43" data-nb-chars="252">Eldred’s freedom to do this with Hawthorne’s work grew from the same source as Disney’s. Hawthorne’s <em>Scarlet Letter</em> had passed into the public domain in 1907. It was free for anyone to take without the permission of the Hawthorne estate or anyone else.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="45" id="idea45" data-nb-words="26" data-nb-chars="161">Some, such as Dover Press and Penguin Classics, take works from the public domain and produce printed editions, which they sell in bookstores across the country.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="46" id="idea46" data-nb-words="34" data-nb-chars="241">Others, such as Disney, take these stories and turn them into animated cartoons, sometimes successfully (<em>Cinderella</em>), sometimes not (<em>The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Treasure Planet</em>). These are all commercial publications of public domain works.</span></p>
      <p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="15" id="chunk15" data-nb-words="97" data-nb-chars="608"><span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="47" id="idea47" data-nb-words="12" data-nb-chars="90">The Internet created the possibility of noncommercial publications of public domain works.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="48" id="idea48" data-nb-words="5" data-nb-chars="29">Eldred’s is just one example.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="49" id="idea49" data-nb-words="6" data-nb-chars="40">There are literally thousands of others.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="50" id="idea50" data-nb-words="28" data-nb-chars="156">Hundreds of thousands from across the world have discovered this platform of expression and now use it to share works that are, by law, free for the taking.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="51" id="idea51" data-nb-words="28" data-nb-chars="177">This has produced what we might call the “noncommercial publishing industry,” which before the Internet was limited to people with large egos or with political or social causes.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="52" id="idea52" data-nb-words="18" data-nb-chars="116">But with the Internet, it includes a wide range of individuals and groups dedicated to spreading culture generally.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:179"><a href="#fn:179">1</a></sup></span></p>

        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="54" id="idea54" data-nb-words="17" data-nb-chars="100">In 1998, Robert Frost’s collection of poems <em>New Hampshire</em> was slated to pass into the public domain.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="55" id="idea55" data-nb-words="11" data-nb-chars="65">Eldred wanted to post that collection in his free public library.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="56" id="idea56" data-nb-words="6" data-nb-chars="28">But Congress got in the way.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="57" id="idea57" data-nb-words="26" data-nb-chars="154">As I described in chapter 10, in 1998, for the eleventh time in forty years, Congress extended the terms of existing copyrights—this time by twenty years.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="58" id="idea58" data-nb-words="58" data-nb-chars="323">Eldred would not be free to add any works more recent than 1923 to his collection until 2019. Indeed, no copyrighted work would pass into the public domain until that year (and not even then, if Congress extends the term again). By contrast, in the same period, more than 1 million patents will pass into the public domain.</span></p>
      <p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="17" id="chunk17" data-nb-words="33" data-nb-chars="209"><span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="59" id="idea59" data-nb-words="33" data-nb-chars="209">This was the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act (CTEA), enacted in memory of the congressman and former musician Sonny Bono, who, his widow, Mary Bono, says, believed that “copyrights should be forever.”<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:180"><a href="#fn:180">2</a></sup></span></p>

        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="62" id="idea62" data-nb-words="15" data-nb-chars="99">In a series of interviews, Eldred announced that he would publish as planned, CTEA notwithstanding.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="63" id="idea63" data-nb-words="28" data-nb-chars="160">But because of a second law passed in 1998, the NET (No Electronic Theft) Act, his act of publishing would make Eldred a felon—whether or not anyone complained.</span>

        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="785" id="idea785" data-nb-words="21" data-nb-chars="138">That was true, but irrelevant, as Congress’s “firm rejection” had occurred long before the Internet made subsequent uses much more likely.</span>
