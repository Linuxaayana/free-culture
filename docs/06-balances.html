<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="6" data-nb-chars="89" data-nb-words="15" id="idea803">There was a general reaction in the blog community that something good might happen here.</span></p>

<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="1" data-nb-chars="52" data-nb-words="9" id="idea804">But at this stage, the lobbyists began to intervene.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="2" data-nb-chars="106" data-nb-words="19" id="idea805"><span id="dictionary-term897" class="dictionary-term" data-dictionary-term="Valenti, Jack" data-term-index="897">Jack Valenti</span> and the MPAA general counsel came to the congresswoman's office to give the view of the MPAA.</span>

<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="4" data-nb-chars="36" data-nb-words="5" id="idea807">The reasons are embarrassingly thin.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="5" data-nb-chars="94" data-nb-words="14" id="idea808">More importantly, their thinness shows something clear about what this debate is really about.</span></p>
<p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="211" data-nb-chars="1170" data-nb-words="199">
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="1" data-nb-chars="126" data-nb-words="19" id="idea809">The MPAA argued first that Congress had “firmly rejected the central concept in the proposed bill”—that copyrights be renewed.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="2" data-nb-chars="138" data-nb-words="21" id="idea810">That was true, but irrelevant, as Congress's “firm rejection” had occurred long before the Internet made subsequent uses much more likely.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="3" data-nb-chars="120" data-nb-words="19" id="idea811">Second, they argued that the proposal would harm poor copyright owners—apparently those who could not afford the $1 fee.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="4" data-nb-chars="113" data-nb-words="16" id="idea812">Third, they argued that Congress had determined that extending a copyright term would encourage restoration work.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="5" data-nb-chars="226" data-nb-words="41" id="idea813">Maybe in the case of the small percentage of work covered by copyright law that is still commercially valuable, but again this was irrelevant, as the proposal would not cut off the extended term unless the $1 fee was not paid.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="6" data-nb-chars="109" data-nb-words="18" id="idea814">Fourth, the MPAA argued that the bill would impose “enormous” costs, since a registration system is not free.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="7" data-nb-chars="127" data-nb-words="23" id="idea815">True enough, but those costs are certainly less than the costs of clearing the rights for a copyright whose owner is not known.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="8" data-nb-chars="118" data-nb-words="22" id="idea816">Fifth, they worried about the risks if the copyright to a story underlying a film were to pass into the public domain.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="9" data-nb-chars="22" data-nb-words="5" id="idea817">But what risk is that?</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="10" data-nb-chars="71" data-nb-words="15" id="idea818">If it is in the public domain, then the film is a valid derivative use.</span></p>

<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="1" data-nb-chars="94" data-nb-words="16" id="idea819">Finally, the MPAA argued that existing law enabled copyright owners to do this if they wanted.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="2" data-nb-chars="118" data-nb-words="22" id="idea820">But the whole point is that there are thousands of copyright owners who don't even know they have a copyright to give.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="3" data-nb-chars="150" data-nb-words="25" id="idea821">Whether they are free to give away their copyright or not—a controversial claim in any case—unless they know about a copyright, they're not likely to.</span></p>

<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="1" data-nb-chars="98" data-nb-words="18" id="idea822"><strong>At the beginning</strong> of this book, I told two stories about the law reacting to changes in technology.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="2" data-nb-chars="35" data-nb-words="6" id="idea823">In the one, common sense prevailed.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="3" data-nb-chars="39" data-nb-words="7" id="idea824">In the other, common sense was delayed.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="4" data-nb-chars="130" data-nb-words="23" id="idea825">The difference between the two stories was the power of the opposition—the power of the side that fought to defend the status quo.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="5" data-nb-chars="57" data-nb-words="9" id="idea826">In both cases, a new technology threatened old interests.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="6" data-nb-chars="115" data-nb-words="19" id="idea827">But in only one case did those interest's have the power to protect themselves against this new competitive threat.</span></p>

<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="1" data-nb-chars="79" data-nb-words="18" id="idea828">I used these two cases as a way to frame the war that this book has been about.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="2" data-nb-chars="60" data-nb-words="12" id="idea829">For here, too, a new technology is forcing the law to react.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="3" data-nb-chars="77" data-nb-words="14" id="idea830">And here, too, we should ask, is the law following or resisting common sense?</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="4" data-nb-chars="66" data-nb-words="11" id="idea831">If common sense supports the law, what explains this common sense?</span></p>

<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="1" data-nb-chars="79" data-nb-words="16" id="idea832">When the issue is piracy, it is right for the law to back the copyright owners.</span>

When the issue is p2p sharing, it is easy to understand why the law backs the owners still: Much of this sharing is wrong, even if much is harmless.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="3" data-nb-chars="271" data-nb-words="46" id="idea834">When the issue is <span id="dictionary-term221" class="dictionary-term" data-dictionary-term="copyright terms for" data-term-index="221">copyright terms for</span> the Mickey Mouses of the world, it is possible still to understand why the law favors Hollywood: Most people don't recognize the reasons for limiting copyright terms; it is thus still possible to see good faith within the resistance.</span></p>

<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="1" data-nb-chars="163" data-nb-words="28" id="idea835">But when the copyright owners oppose a proposal such as the <span id="dictionary-term310" class="dictionary-term" data-dictionary-term="Eldred, Eric" data-term-index="310">Eldred</span> Act, then, finally, there is an example that lays bare the naked self-interest driving this war.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="2" data-nb-chars="79" data-nb-words="13" id="idea836">This act would free an extraordinary range of content that is otherwise unused.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="3" data-nb-chars="103" data-nb-words="15" id="idea837">It wouldn't interfere with any copyright owner's desire to exercise continued control over his content.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="4" data-nb-chars="104" data-nb-words="17" id="idea838">It would simply liberate what <span id="dictionary-term498" class="dictionary-term" data-dictionary-term="Kelly, Kevin" data-term-index="498">Kevin Kelly</span> calls the “Dark Content” that fills <span id="dictionary-term28" class="dictionary-term" data-dictionary-term="archives, digital" data-term-index="28">archives</span> around the world.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="5" data-nb-chars="82" data-nb-words="15" id="idea839">So when the warriors oppose a change like this, we should ask one simple question:</span></p>

<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="1" data-nb-chars="66" data-nb-words="10" id="idea841">With very little effort, the warriors could protect their content.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="2" data-nb-chars="98" data-nb-words="17" id="idea842">So the effort to block something like the <span id="dictionary-term310" class="dictionary-term" data-dictionary-term="Eldred, Eric" data-term-index="310">Eldred</span> Act is not really about protecting <em>their</em> content.</span>

<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="4" data-nb-chars="242" data-nb-words="42" id="idea844">It is another step to assure that the public domain will never compete, that there will be no use of content that is not commercially controlled, and that there will be no <span id="dictionary-term661" class="dictionary-term" data-dictionary-term="commercial" data-term-index="661">commercial</span> use of content that doesn't require <em>their</em> permission first.</span></p>

<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="2" data-nb-chars="190" data-nb-words="27" id="idea861">One phenomenon that the Internet created was a world of noncommercial pornographers—people who were distributing porn but were not making money directly or indirectly from that distribution.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="3" data-nb-chars="114" data-nb-words="20" id="idea862">Such a class didn't exist before the Internet came into being because the costs of distributing porn were so high.</span>
