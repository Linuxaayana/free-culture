<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="3" data-nb-chars="116" data-nb-words="22" id="idea37">Before the Internet, most of us didn't have to worry much about data about our lives that we broadcast to the world.</span>

<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="1" data-nb-chars="233" data-nb-words="40" id="idea41">Well, if we think in terms of the modalities I described in chapter 10, your privacy was assured because of an inefficient architecture for gathering data and hence a market constraint (cost) on anyone who wanted to gather that data.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="2" data-nb-chars="109" data-nb-words="21" id="idea42">If you were a suspected spy for North Korea, working for the CIA, no doubt your privacy would not be assured.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="3" data-nb-chars="112" data-nb-words="20" id="idea43">But that's because the CIA would (we hope) find it valuable enough to spend the thousands required to track you.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="4" data-nb-chars="60" data-nb-words="12" id="idea44">But for most of us (again, we can hope), spying doesn't pay.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="5" data-nb-chars="103" data-nb-words="17" id="idea45">The highly inefficient architecture of real space means we all enjoy a fairly robust amount of privacy.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="6" data-nb-chars="45" data-nb-words="8" id="idea46">That privacy is guaranteed to us by friction.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="7" data-nb-chars="217" data-nb-words="40" id="idea47">Not by law (there is no law protecting “privacy” in public places), and in many places, not by norms (snooping and gossip are just fun), but instead, by the costs that friction imposes on anyone who would want to spy.</span></p>

<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="1" data-nb-chars="92" data-nb-words="15" id="idea48">Enter the Internet, where the cost of tracking <span id="dictionary-term85" class="dictionary-term" data-dictionary-term="browsing" data-term-index="85">browsing</span> in particular has become quite tiny.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="2" data-nb-chars="205" data-nb-words="38" id="idea49">If you're a customer at <span id="dictionary-term16" class="dictionary-term" data-dictionary-term="Amazon" data-term-index="16">Amazon</span>, then as you browse the pages, <span id="dictionary-term16" class="dictionary-term" data-dictionary-term="Amazon" data-term-index="16">Amazon</span> collects the data about what you've looked at.

<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="3" data-nb-chars="126" data-nb-words="25" id="idea50">Now, because of the architecture of the Net and the function of <span id="dictionary-term159" class="dictionary-term" data-dictionary-term="cookies, Internet" data-term-index="159">cookies</span> on the Net, it is easier to collect the data than not.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="4" data-nb-chars="96" data-nb-words="14" id="idea51">The friction has disappeared, and hence any “privacy” protected by the friction disappears, too.</span></p>

<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="4" data-nb-chars="134" data-nb-words="21" id="idea55">If it becomes simple to gather and sort who does what in electronic spaces, then the friction-induced privacy of yesterday disappears.</span></p>

<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="1" data-nb-chars="86" data-nb-words="16" id="idea56">It is this reality that explains the push of many to define “privacy” on the Internet.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="2" data-nb-chars="138" data-nb-words="25" id="idea57">It is the recognition that technology can remove what friction before gave us that leads many to push for laws to do what friction did.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup></span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="3" data-nb-chars="91" data-nb-words="18" id="idea58">And whether you're in favor of those laws or not, it is the pattern that is important here.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="4" data-nb-chars="94" data-nb-words="16" id="idea59">We must take affirmative steps to secure a kind of freedom that was passively provided before.</span>
<span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="5" data-nb-chars="128" data-nb-words="21" id="idea60">A change in technology now forces those who believe in privacy to affirmatively act where, before, privacy was given by default.</span></p>
