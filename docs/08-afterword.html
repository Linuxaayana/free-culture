        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="18" id="idea18" data-nb-words="20" data-nb-chars="118">The “All Rights Reserved” sorts believe that you should ask permission before you “use” a copyrighted work in any way.</span>

        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="21" id="idea21" data-nb-words="13" data-nb-chars="85">Content could be copied perfectly and cheaply; rights could not easily be controlled.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="22" id="idea22" data-nb-words="21" data-nb-chars="138">Thus, regardless of anyone’s desire, the effective regime of copyright under the original design of the Internet was “no rights reserved.”</span>

        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="27" id="idea27" data-nb-words="26" data-nb-chars="181">Through legislation, litigation, and changes to the network’s design, copyright holders have been able to change the essential character of the environment of the original Internet.</span>

        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="29" id="idea29" data-nb-words="21" data-nb-chars="147">The architecture and law that surround the Internet’s design will increasingly produce an environment where all use of content requires permission.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="30" id="idea30" data-nb-words="25" data-nb-chars="142">The “cut and paste” world that defines the Internet today will become a “get permission to cut and paste” world that is a creator’s nightmare.</span></p>

        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="37" id="idea37" data-nb-words="22" data-nb-chars="116">Before the Internet, most of us didn’t have to worry much about data about our lives that we broadcast to the world.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="38" id="idea38" data-nb-words="31" data-nb-chars="172">If you walked into a bookstore and browsed through some of the works of Karl Marx, you didn’t need to worry about explaining your browsing habits to your neighbors or boss.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="39" id="idea39" data-nb-words="8" data-nb-chars="50">The “privacy” of your browsing habits was assured.</span></p>

      <p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="16" id="chunk16" data-nb-words="158" data-nb-chars="879"><span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="41" id="idea41" data-nb-words="40" data-nb-chars="233">Well, if we think in terms of the modalities I described in chapter 10, your privacy was assured because of an inefficient architecture for gathering data and hence a market constraint (cost) on anyone who wanted to gather that data.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="42" id="idea42" data-nb-words="21" data-nb-chars="109">If you were a suspected spy for North Korea, working for the CIA, no doubt your privacy would not be assured.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="43" id="idea43" data-nb-words="20" data-nb-chars="112">But that’s because the CIA would (we hope) find it valuable enough to spend the thousands required to track you.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="44" id="idea44" data-nb-words="12" data-nb-chars="60">But for most of us (again, we can hope), spying doesn’t pay.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="45" id="idea45" data-nb-words="17" data-nb-chars="103">The highly inefficient architecture of real space means we all enjoy a fairly robust amount of privacy.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="46" id="idea46" data-nb-words="8" data-nb-chars="45">That privacy is guaranteed to us by friction.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="47" id="idea47" data-nb-words="40" data-nb-chars="217">Not by law (there is no law protecting “privacy” in public places), and in many places, not by norms (snooping and gossip are just fun), but instead, by the costs that friction imposes on anyone who would want to spy.</span></p>
      <p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="17" id="chunk17" data-nb-words="92" data-nb-chars="519"><span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="48" id="idea48" data-nb-words="15" data-nb-chars="92">Enter the Internet, where the cost of tracking browsing in particular has become quite tiny.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="49" id="idea49" data-nb-words="38" data-nb-chars="205">If you’re a customer at Amazon, then as you browse the pages, Amazon collects the data about what you’ve looked at. You know this because at the side of the page, there’s a list of “recently viewed” pages.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="50" id="idea50" data-nb-words="25" data-nb-chars="126">Now, because of the architecture of the Net and the function of cookies on the Net, it is easier to collect the data than not.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="51" id="idea51" data-nb-words="14" data-nb-chars="96">The friction has disappeared, and hence any “privacy” protected by the friction disappears, too.</span></p>
      <p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="18" id="chunk18" data-nb-words="82" data-nb-chars="478"><span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="52" id="idea52" data-nb-words="7" data-nb-chars="38">Amazon, of course, is not the problem.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="53" id="idea53" data-nb-words="8" data-nb-chars="44">But we might begin to worry about libraries.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="54" id="idea54" data-nb-words="46" data-nb-chars="262">If you’re one of those crazy lefties who thinks that people should have the “right” to browse in a library without the government knowing which books you look at (I’m one of those lefties, too), then this change in the technology of monitoring might concern you.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="55" id="idea55" data-nb-words="21" data-nb-chars="134">If it becomes simple to gather and sort who does what in electronic spaces, then the friction-induced privacy of yesterday disappears.</span></p>
      <p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="19" id="chunk19" data-nb-words="96" data-nb-chars="535"><span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="56" id="idea56" data-nb-words="16" data-nb-chars="86">It is this reality that explains the push of many to define “privacy” on the Internet.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="57" id="idea57" data-nb-words="25" data-nb-chars="136">It is the recognition that technology can remove what friction before gave us that leads many to push for laws to do what friction did.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:210"><a href="#fn:210">1</a></sup></span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="58" id="idea58" data-nb-words="18" data-nb-chars="91">And whether you’re in favor of those laws or not, it is the pattern that is important here.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="59" id="idea59" data-nb-words="16" data-nb-chars="94">We must take affirmative steps to secure a kind of freedom that was passively provided before.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="60" id="idea60" data-nb-words="21" data-nb-chars="128">A change in technology now forces those who believe in privacy to affirmatively act where, before, privacy was given by default.</span></p>
      <p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="20" id="chunk20" data-nb-words="59" data-nb-chars="360"><span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="61" id="idea61" data-nb-words="14" data-nb-chars="76">A similar story could be told about the birth of the free software movement.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="62" id="idea62" data-nb-words="18" data-nb-chars="129">When computers with software were first made available commercially, the software—both the source code and the binaries—was free.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="63" id="idea63" data-nb-words="27" data-nb-chars="155">You couldn’t run a program written for a Data General machine on an IBM machine, so Data General and IBM didn’t care much about controlling their software.</span></p>
      <p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="21" id="chunk21" data-nb-words="64" data-nb-chars="349"><span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="64" id="idea64" data-nb-words="40" data-nb-chars="213">That was the world Richard Stallman was born into, and while he was a researcher at MIT, he grew to love the community that developed when one was free to explore and tinker with the software that ran on machines.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="65" id="idea65" data-nb-words="24" data-nb-chars="136">Being a smart sort himself, and a talented programmer, Stallman grew to depend upon the freedom to add to or modify other people’s work.</span></p>
      <p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="22" id="chunk22" data-nb-words="109" data-nb-chars="602"><span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="66" id="idea66" data-nb-words="12" data-nb-chars="69">In an academic setting, at least, that’s not a terribly radical idea.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="67" id="idea67" data-nb-words="16" data-nb-chars="87">In a math department, anyone would be free to tinker with a proof that someone offered.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="68" id="idea68" data-nb-words="67" data-nb-chars="363">If you thought you had a better way to prove a theorem, you could take what someone else did and change it. In a classics department, if you believed a colleague’s translation of a recently discovered text was flawed, you were free to improve it. Thus, to Stallman, it seemed obvious that you should be free to tinker with and improve the code that ran a machine.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="69" id="idea69" data-nb-words="4" data-nb-chars="25">This, too, was knowledge.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="70" id="idea70" data-nb-words="10" data-nb-chars="58">Why shouldn’t it be open for criticism like anything else?</span></p>
      <p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="23" id="chunk23" data-nb-words="84" data-nb-chars="472"><span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="71" id="idea71" data-nb-words="5" data-nb-chars="30">No one answered that question.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="72" id="idea72" data-nb-words="8" data-nb-chars="59">Instead, the architecture of revenue for computing changed.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="73" id="idea73" data-nb-words="30" data-nb-chars="167">As it became possible to import programs from one system to another, it became economically attractive (at least in the view of some) to hide the code of your program.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="74" id="idea74" data-nb-words="10" data-nb-chars="72">So, too, as companies started selling peripherals for mainframe systems.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="75" id="idea75" data-nb-words="31" data-nb-chars="144">If I could just take your printer driver and copy it, then that would make it easier for me to sell a printer to the market than it was for you.</span></p>
      <p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="24" id="chunk24" data-nb-words="59" data-nb-chars="345"><span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="76" id="idea76" data-nb-words="21" data-nb-chars="134">Thus, the practice of proprietary code began to spread, and by the early 1980s, Stallman found himself surrounded by proprietary code.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="77" id="idea77" data-nb-words="16" data-nb-chars="85">The world of free software had been erased by a change in the economics of computing.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="78" id="idea78" data-nb-words="22" data-nb-chars="126">And as he believed, if he did nothing about it, then the freedom to change and share software would be fundamentally weakened.</span></p>
      <p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="25" id="chunk25" data-nb-words="46" data-nb-chars="270"><span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="79" id="idea79" data-nb-words="24" data-nb-chars="136">Therefore, in 1984, Stallman began a project to build a free operating system, so that at least a strain of free software would survive.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="80" id="idea80" data-nb-words="22" data-nb-chars="134">That was the birth of the GNU project, into which Linus Torvalds’s “Linux” kernel was added to produce the GNU/Linux operating system.</span></p>
      <p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="26" id="chunk26" data-nb-words="89" data-nb-chars="544"><span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="81" id="idea81" data-nb-words="18" data-nb-chars="98">Stallman’s technique was to use copyright law to build a world of software that must be kept free.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="82" id="idea82" data-nb-words="25" data-nb-chars="161">Software licensed under the Free Software Foundation’s GPL cannot be modified and distributed unless the source code for that software is made available as well.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="83" id="idea83" data-nb-words="15" data-nb-chars="90">Thus, anyone building upon GPL’d software would have to make their buildings free as well.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="84" id="idea84" data-nb-words="20" data-nb-chars="120">This would assure, Stallman believed, that an ecology of code would develop that remained free for others to build upon.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="85" id="idea85" data-nb-words="11" data-nb-chars="75">His fundamental goal was freedom; innovative creative code was a byproduct.</span></p>

        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="87" id="idea87" data-nb-words="17" data-nb-chars="84">He was seeking a way to rebuild a kind of freedom that was taken for granted before.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="88" id="idea88" data-nb-words="21" data-nb-chars="148">Through the affirmative use of licenses that bind copyrighted code, Stallman was affirmatively reclaiming a space where free software would survive.</span>
