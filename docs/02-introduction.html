        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="40" id="idea40" data-nb-words="40" data-nb-chars="254">The Wright brothers spat airplanes into the technological meme pool; the idea then spread like a virus in a chicken coop; farmers like the Causbys found themselves surrounded by “what seemed reasonable” given the technology that the Wrights had produced.</span>
