        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="31" id="idea31" data-nb-words="15" data-nb-chars="84">It might well be a possible design for a system of law protecting creative property.</span>

        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="36" id="idea36" data-nb-words="7" data-nb-chars="42">The current debate has this turned around.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="37" id="idea37" data-nb-words="17" data-nb-chars="97">We have become so concerned with protecting the instrument that we are losing sight of the value.</span></p>

        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="39" id="idea39" data-nb-words="16" data-nb-chars="98">Copyright law at its birth had only publishing as its concern; copyright law today regulates both.</span></p>

        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="41" id="idea41" data-nb-words="15" data-nb-chars="105">The technologies of publishing were expensive; that meant the vast majority of publishing was commercial.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="42" id="idea42" data-nb-words="20" data-nb-chars="127">Commercial entities could bear the burden of the law—even the burden of the Byzantine complexity that copyright law has become.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="43" id="idea43" data-nb-words="9" data-nb-chars="47">It was just one more expense of doing business.</span></p>

        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="45" id="idea45" data-nb-words="15" data-nb-chars="95">The law controls not just the creativity of commercial creators but effectively that of anyone.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="46" id="idea46" data-nb-words="29" data-nb-chars="177">Although that expansion would not matter much if copyright law regulated only “copying,” when the law regulates as broadly and obscurely as it does, the extension matters a lot.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="47" id="idea47" data-nb-words="25" data-nb-chars="176">The burden of this law now vastly outweighs any original benefit—certainly as it affects noncommercial creativity, and increasingly as it affects commercial creativity as well.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="48" id="idea48" data-nb-words="30" data-nb-chars="178">Thus, as we’ll see more clearly in the chapters below, the law’s role is less and less to support creativity, and more and more to protect certain industries against competition.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="49" id="idea49" data-nb-words="35" data-nb-chars="237">Just at the time digital technology could unleash an extraordinary range of commercial and noncommercial creativity, the law burdens this creativity with insanely complex and vague rules and with the threat of obscenely severe penalties.</span>

        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="382" id="idea382" data-nb-words="11" data-nb-chars="62">The high school was a very poor inner-city Los Angeles school.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="383" id="idea383" data-nb-words="12" data-nb-chars="70">In all the traditional measures of success, this school was a failure.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="384" id="idea384" data-nb-words="26" data-nb-chars="159">But Daley and Barish ran a program that gave kids an opportunity to use film to express meaning about something the students know something about—gun violence.</span></p>
      <p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="95" id="chunk95" data-nb-words="74" data-nb-chars="409"><span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="385" id="idea385" data-nb-words="17" data-nb-chars="96">The class was held on Friday afternoons, and it created a relatively new problem for the school.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="386" id="idea386" data-nb-words="21" data-nb-chars="116">While the challenge in most classes was getting the kids to come, the challenge in this class was keeping them away.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="387" id="idea387" data-nb-words="16" data-nb-chars="76">The “kids were showing up at 6 A.M. and leaving at 5 at night,” said Barish.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="388" id="idea388" data-nb-words="20" data-nb-chars="121">They were working harder than in any other class to do what education should be about—learning how to express themselves.</span></p>
      <p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="96" id="chunk96" data-nb-words="167" data-nb-chars="970"><span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="389" id="idea389" data-nb-words="42" data-nb-chars="259">Using whatever “free web stuff they could find,” and relatively simple tools to enable the kids to mix “image, sound, and text,” Barish said this class produced a series of projects that showed something about gun violence that few would otherwise understand.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="390" id="idea390" data-nb-words="11" data-nb-chars="55">This was an issue close to the lives of these students.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="391" id="idea391" data-nb-words="22" data-nb-chars="119">The project “gave them a tool and empowered them to be able to both understand it and talk about it,” Barish explained.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="392" id="idea392" data-nb-words="18" data-nb-chars="125">That tool succeeded in creating expression—far more successfully and powerfully than could have been created using only text.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="393" id="idea393" data-nb-words="46" data-nb-chars="260">“If you had said to these students, ‘you have to do it in text,’ they would’ve just thrown their hands up and gone and done something else,” Barish described, in part, no doubt, because expressing themselves in text is not something these students can do well.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="394" id="idea394" data-nb-words="14" data-nb-chars="70">Yet neither is text a form in which <em>these</em> ideas can be expressed well.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="395" id="idea395" data-nb-words="14" data-nb-chars="82">The power of this message depended upon its connection to this form of expression.</span></p>

        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="398" id="idea398" data-nb-words="12" data-nb-chars="85">Education, Daley explained, is about giving students a way of “constructing meaning.”</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="399" id="idea399" data-nb-words="20" data-nb-chars="109">To say that that means just writing is like saying teaching writing is only about teaching kids how to spell.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="400" id="idea400" data-nb-words="12" data-nb-chars="86">Text is one part—and increasingly, not the most powerful part—of constructing meaning.</span>
