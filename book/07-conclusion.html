      <p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="2" id="chunk2" data-nb-words="42" data-nb-chars="296"><span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="2" id="idea2" data-nb-words="12" data-nb-chars="68"><strong>There are more</strong> than 35 million people with the AIDS virus worldwide.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="3" id="idea3" data-nb-words="8" data-nb-chars="55">Twenty-five million of them live in sub-Saharan Africa.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="4" id="idea4" data-nb-words="5" data-nb-chars="36">Seventeen million have already died.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="5" id="idea5" data-nb-words="10" data-nb-chars="86">Seventeen million Africans is proportional percentage-wise to seven million Americans.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="6" id="idea6" data-nb-words="7" data-nb-chars="51">More importantly, it is seventeen million Africans.</span></p>
      <p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="3" id="chunk3" data-nb-words="60" data-nb-chars="359"><span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="7" id="idea7" data-nb-words="14" data-nb-chars="71">There is no cure for AIDS, but there are drugs to slow its progression.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="8" id="idea8" data-nb-words="14" data-nb-chars="99">These antiretroviral therapies are still experimental, but they have already had a dramatic effect.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="9" id="idea9" data-nb-words="23" data-nb-chars="135">In the United States, AIDS patients who regularly take a cocktail of these drugs increase their life expectancy by ten to twenty years.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="10" id="idea10" data-nb-words="9" data-nb-chars="54">For some, the drugs make the disease almost invisible.</span></p>
      <p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="4" id="chunk4" data-nb-words="68" data-nb-chars="406"><span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="11" id="idea11" data-nb-words="4" data-nb-chars="26">These drugs are expensive.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="12" id="idea12" data-nb-words="19" data-nb-chars="112">When they were first introduced in the United States, they cost between $10,000 and $15,000 per person per year.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="13" id="idea13" data-nb-words="6" data-nb-chars="34">Today, some cost $25,000 per year.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="14" id="idea14" data-nb-words="31" data-nb-chars="182">At these prices, of course, no African nation can afford the drugs for the vast majority of its population: $15,000 is thirty times the per capita gross national product of Zimbabwe.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="15" id="idea15" data-nb-words="8" data-nb-chars="52">At these prices, the drugs are totally unavailable.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:195"><a href="#fn:195">1</a></sup></span></p>
      <p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="5" id="chunk5" data-nb-words="66" data-nb-chars="383"><span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="16" id="idea16" data-nb-words="13" data-nb-chars="77">These prices are not high because the ingredients of the drugs are expensive.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="17" id="idea17" data-nb-words="11" data-nb-chars="65">These prices are high because the drugs are protected by patents.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="18" id="idea18" data-nb-words="17" data-nb-chars="116">The drug companies that produced these life-saving mixes enjoy at least a twenty-year monopoly for their inventions.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="19" id="idea19" data-nb-words="14" data-nb-chars="74">They use that monopoly power to extract the most they can from the market.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="20" id="idea20" data-nb-words="11" data-nb-chars="51">That power is in turn used to keep the prices high.</span></p>
      <p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="6" id="chunk6" data-nb-words="99" data-nb-chars="544"><span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="21" id="idea21" data-nb-words="11" data-nb-chars="69">There are many who are skeptical of patents, especially drug patents.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="22" id="idea22" data-nb-words="3" data-nb-chars="9">I am not.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="23" id="idea23" data-nb-words="26" data-nb-chars="146">Indeed, of all the areas of research that might be supported by patents, drug research is, in my view, the clearest case where patents are needed.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="24" id="idea24" data-nb-words="33" data-nb-chars="171">The patent gives the drug company some assurance that if it is successful in inventing a new drug to treat a disease, it will be able to earn back its investment and more.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="25" id="idea25" data-nb-words="7" data-nb-chars="49">This is socially an extremely valuable incentive.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="26" id="idea26" data-nb-words="19" data-nb-chars="100">I am the last person who would argue that the law should abolish it, at least without other changes.</span></p>
      <p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="7" id="chunk7" data-nb-words="53" data-nb-chars="305"><span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="27" id="idea27" data-nb-words="11" data-nb-chars="58">But it is one thing to support patents, even drug patents.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="28" id="idea28" data-nb-words="13" data-nb-chars="64">It is another thing to determine how best to deal with a crisis.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="29" id="idea29" data-nb-words="29" data-nb-chars="183">And as African leaders began to recognize the devastation that AIDS was bringing, they started looking for ways to import HIV treatments at costs significantly below the market price.</span></p>
      <p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="8" id="chunk8" data-nb-words="74" data-nb-chars="439"><span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="30" id="idea30" data-nb-words="7" data-nb-chars="37">In 1997, South Africa tried one tack.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="31" id="idea31" data-nb-words="28" data-nb-chars="158">It passed a law to allow the importation of patented medicines that had been produced or sold in another nation’s market with the consent of the patent owner.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="32" id="idea32" data-nb-words="17" data-nb-chars="88">For example, if the drug was sold in India, it could be imported into Africa from India.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="33" id="idea33" data-nb-words="22" data-nb-chars="156">This is called “parallel importation,” and it is generally permitted under international trade law and is specifically permitted within the European Union.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:196"><a href="#fn:196">2</a></sup></span></p>
      <p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="9" id="chunk9" data-nb-words="168" data-nb-chars="1114"><span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="34" id="idea34" data-nb-words="8" data-nb-chars="55">However, the United States government opposed the bill.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="35" id="idea35" data-nb-words="4" data-nb-chars="26">Indeed, more than opposed.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="36" id="idea36" data-nb-words="23" data-nb-chars="176">As the International Intellectual Property Association characterized it, “The U.S. government pressured South Africa … not to permit compulsory licensing or parallel imports.”<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:197"><a href="#fn:197">3</a></sup></span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="37" id="idea37" data-nb-words="35" data-nb-chars="218">Through the Office of the United States Trade Representative, the government asked South Africa to change the law—and to add pressure to that request, in 1998, the USTR listed South Africa for possible trade sanctions.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="38" id="idea38" data-nb-words="20" data-nb-chars="141">That same year, more than forty pharmaceutical companies began proceedings in the South African courts to challenge the government’s actions.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="39" id="idea39" data-nb-words="41" data-nb-chars="281">The United States was then joined by other governments from the EU. Their claim, and the claim of the pharmaceutical companies, was that South Africa was violating its obligations under international law by discriminating against a particular kind of patent—pharmaceutical patents.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="40" id="idea40" data-nb-words="37" data-nb-chars="217">The demand of these governments, with the United States in the lead, was that South Africa respect these patents as it respects any other patent, regardless of any effect on the treatment of AIDS within South Africa.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:198"><a href="#fn:198">4</a></sup></span></p>
      <p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="10" id="chunk10" data-nb-words="86" data-nb-chars="511"><span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="41" id="idea41" data-nb-words="11" data-nb-chars="65">We should place the intervention by the United States in context.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="42" id="idea42" data-nb-words="16" data-nb-chars="92">No doubt patents are not the most important reason that Africans don’t have access to drugs.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="43" id="idea43" data-nb-words="13" data-nb-chars="85">Poverty and the total absence of an effective health care infrastructure matter more.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="44" id="idea44" data-nb-words="24" data-nb-chars="133">But whether patents are the most important reason or not, the price of drugs has an effect on their demand, and patents affect price.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="45" id="idea45" data-nb-words="22" data-nb-chars="136">And so, whether massive or marginal, there was an effect from our government’s intervention to stop the flow of medications into Africa.</span></p>
      <p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="11" id="chunk11" data-nb-words="73" data-nb-chars="417"><span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="46" id="idea46" data-nb-words="21" data-nb-chars="128">By stopping the flow of HIV treatment into Africa, the United States government was not saving drugs for United States citizens.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="47" id="idea47" data-nb-words="52" data-nb-chars="289">This is not like wheat (if they eat it, we can’t); instead, the flow that the United States intervened to stop was, in effect, a flow of knowledge: information about how to take chemicals that exist within Africa, and turn those chemicals into drugs that would save 15 to 30 million lives.</span></p>
      <p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="12" id="chunk12" data-nb-words="75" data-nb-chars="443"><span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="48" id="idea48" data-nb-words="21" data-nb-chars="135">Nor was the intervention by the United States going to protect the profits of United States drug companies—at least, not substantially.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="49" id="idea49" data-nb-words="23" data-nb-chars="119">It was not as if these countries were in the position to buy the drugs for the prices the drug companies were charging.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="50" id="idea50" data-nb-words="15" data-nb-chars="84">Again, the Africans are wildly too poor to afford these drugs at the offered prices.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="51" id="idea51" data-nb-words="16" data-nb-chars="105">Stopping the parallel import of these drugs would not substantially increase the sales by U.S. companies.</span></p>
      <p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="13" id="chunk13" data-nb-words="68" data-nb-chars="426"><span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="52" id="idea52" data-nb-words="28" data-nb-chars="168">Instead, the argument in favor of restricting this flow of information, which was needed to save the lives of millions, was an argument about the sanctity of property.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:199"><a href="#fn:199">5</a></sup></span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="53" id="idea53" data-nb-words="16" data-nb-chars="102">It was because “intellectual property” would be violated that these drugs should not flow into Africa.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="54" id="idea54" data-nb-words="24" data-nb-chars="156">It was a principle about the importance of “intellectual property” that led these government actors to intervene against the South African response to AIDS.</span></p>
      <p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="14" id="chunk14" data-nb-words="102" data-nb-chars="520"><span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="55" id="idea55" data-nb-words="7" data-nb-chars="32">Now just step back for a moment.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="56" id="idea56" data-nb-words="25" data-nb-chars="120">There will be a time thirty years from now when our children look back at us and ask, how could we have let this happen?</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="57" id="idea57" data-nb-words="38" data-nb-chars="191">How could we allow a policy to be pursued whose direct cost would be to speed the death of 15 to 30 million Africans, and whose only real benefit would be to uphold the “sanctity” of an idea?</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="58" id="idea58" data-nb-words="16" data-nb-chars="92">What possible justification could there ever be for a policy that results in so many deaths?</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="59" id="idea59" data-nb-words="16" data-nb-chars="85">What exactly is the insanity that would allow so many to die for such an abstraction?</span></p>
      <p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="15" id="chunk15" data-nb-words="70" data-nb-chars="410"><span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="60" id="idea60" data-nb-words="5" data-nb-chars="30">Some blame the drug companies.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="61" id="idea61" data-nb-words="5" data-nb-chars="31">I don’t. They are corporations.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="62" id="idea62" data-nb-words="12" data-nb-chars="68">Their managers are ordered by law to make money for the corporation.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="63" id="idea63" data-nb-words="22" data-nb-chars="117">They push a certain patent policy not because of ideals, but because it is the policy that makes them the most money.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="64" id="idea64" data-nb-words="26" data-nb-chars="164">And it only makes them the most money because of a certain corruption within our political system—a corruption the drug companies are certainly not responsible for.</span></p>
      <p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="16" id="chunk16" data-nb-words="64" data-nb-chars="371"><span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="65" id="idea65" data-nb-words="9" data-nb-chars="60">The corruption is our own politicians’ failure of integrity.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="66" id="idea66" data-nb-words="25" data-nb-chars="143">For the drug companies would love—they say, and I believe them—to sell their drugs as cheaply as they can to countries in Africa and elsewhere.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="67" id="idea67" data-nb-words="26" data-nb-chars="145">There are issues they’d have to resolve to make sure the drugs didn’t get back into the United States, but those are mere problems of technology.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="68" id="idea68" data-nb-words="4" data-nb-chars="23">They could be overcome.</span></p>
      <p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="17" id="chunk17" data-nb-words="136" data-nb-chars="798"><span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="69" id="idea69" data-nb-words="8" data-nb-chars="52">A different problem, however, could not be overcome.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="70" id="idea70" data-nb-words="71" data-nb-chars="382">This is the fear of the grandstanding politician who would call the presidents of the drug companies before a Senate or House hearing, and ask, “How is it you can sell this HIV drug in Africa for only $1 a pill, but the same drug would cost an American $1,500?” Because there is no “sound bite” answer to that question, its effect would be to induce regulation of prices in America.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="71" id="idea71" data-nb-words="12" data-nb-chars="69">The drug companies thus avoid this spiral by avoiding the first step.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="72" id="idea72" data-nb-words="9" data-nb-chars="55">They reinforce the idea that property should be sacred.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="73" id="idea73" data-nb-words="17" data-nb-chars="115">They adopt a rational strategy in an irrational context, with the unintended consequence that perhaps millions die.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="74" id="idea74" data-nb-words="19" data-nb-chars="125">And that rational strategy thus becomes framed in terms of this ideal—the sanctity of an idea called “intellectual property.”</span></p>
      <p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="18" id="chunk18" data-nb-words="40" data-nb-chars="212"><span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="75" id="idea75" data-nb-words="14" data-nb-chars="72">So when the common sense of your child confronts you, what will you say?</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="76" id="idea76" data-nb-words="22" data-nb-chars="119">When the common sense of a generation finally revolts against what we have done, how will we justify what we have done?</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="77" id="idea77" data-nb-words="4" data-nb-chars="21">What is the argument?</span></p>
      <p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="19" id="chunk19" data-nb-words="108" data-nb-chars="648"><span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="78" id="idea78" data-nb-words="23" data-nb-chars="146">A sensible patent policy could endorse and strongly support the patent system without having to reach everyone everywhere in exactly the same way.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="79" id="idea79" data-nb-words="58" data-nb-chars="347">Just as a sensible copyright policy could endorse and strongly support a copyright system without having to regulate the spread of culture perfectly and forever, a sensible patent policy could endorse and strongly support a patent system without having to block the spread of drugs to a country not rich enough to afford market prices in any case.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="80" id="idea80" data-nb-words="11" data-nb-chars="62">A sensible policy, in other words, could be a balanced policy.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="81" id="idea81" data-nb-words="16" data-nb-chars="93">For most of our history, both copyright and patent policies were balanced in just this sense.</span></p>

        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="83" id="idea83" data-nb-words="16" data-nb-chars="91">We have lost the critical eye that helps us see the difference between truth and extremism.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="84" id="idea84" data-nb-words="41" data-nb-chars="258">A certain property fundamentalism, having no connection to our tradition, now reigns in this culture—bizarrely, and with consequences more grave to the spread of ideas and culture than almost any other single policy decision that we as a democracy will make.</span></p>
      <p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="21" id="chunk21" data-nb-words="120" data-nb-chars="647"><span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="85" id="idea85" data-nb-words="24" data-nb-chars="120"><strong>A simple idea</strong> blinds us, and under the cover of darkness, much happens that most of us would reject if any of us looked.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="86" id="idea86" data-nb-words="31" data-nb-chars="158">So uncritically do we accept the idea of property in ideas that we don’t even notice how monstrous it is to deny ideas to a people who are dying without them.</span>
        <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="87" id="idea87" data-nb-words="33" data-nb-chars="195">So uncritically do we accept the idea of property in culture that we don’t even question when the control of that property removes our ability, as a people, to develop our culture democratically.</span>
